Our Project is based on a Youtube Channel, it has the basic functions of a youtube channel.

It has 4 sections which are based on the Navbar which are:

"Base Layout"
We wanted to be unique with our youtube channel so we formed a dark mode styled youtube channel with the base colours,
Black and Green. And made our background a live motion to add a bit of creativity to our site.

"Home Page"
The home page consists of the logo of "Martins Youtube Channel" which you can click to quickly gain access to "Martins Youtube Channel" 
without having to navigate through the navbar and this is the same for "Johns Youtube Channel".

This channel is created by Martins, He has 3 sections on this page, a biography section with his website logo, an uploads section where he uploaded
his youtube videos, with the view count, the time it was uploaded and duration of the videos attached to the image, and the last section is a favourite videos
